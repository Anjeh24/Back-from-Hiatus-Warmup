# Back-from-Hiatus-Warmup
A simple swap app with media queries
A simple switch app (switching images back and forth with a click) created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also added media queries so it appears presentable on different screen sizes.
Will be working on creating complex apps. This was just a refresher after being off for a while.
